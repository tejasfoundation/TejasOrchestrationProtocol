# Abstract

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly depend on vast datasets for training, yet generating and processing these datasets imposes significant environmental costs. Traditional synthetic data generation techniques often require compute-intensive models, leading to substantial energy consumption and carbon emissions. This paper introduces the **Tejas Orchestration Protocol (TOP)**, a novel synthetic data generation approach leveraging variable building block documents and rule-based randomizers to create scalable, high-quality synthetic datasets with minimal compute overhead. We demonstrate that TOP can dramatically reduce the carbon footprint associated with synthetic data generation, enabling more sustainable AI development and democratizing access to AI technologies worldwide.

# 1. Introduction

AIâ€™s rapid evolution has fueled unprecedented technological progress but at a growing environmental cost. The energy demands of training large-scale models and creating synthetic data contribute significantly to global carbon emissions. As the AI community seeks greener solutions, synthetic data emerges as a key enabler for privacy, scalability, and diversity in AI training. However, current synthetic data generation relies heavily on generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, or other computationally intensive algorithms that negate sustainability goals.

This paper presents the **Tejas Orchestration Protocol (TOP)**, a fundamentally new technique designed to **decarbonize synthetic data generation**. TOP constructs synthetic datasets by orchestrating combinations of **variable building block documents** through **rule-based randomizers**, eliminating the need for heavy compute resources. Our approach is scalable, customizable, and cost-effective, offering a practical pathway for sustainable AI.

# 2. Related Work

Synthetic data methods primarily fall into two categories: generative modeling and rule-based generation.

- **Generative Models:** GANs, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models produce high-fidelity synthetic data but require extensive compute cycles and GPU usage, translating into high energy consumption. Research highlights the carbon footprint of training these models can be comparable to or exceed large industrial processes.

- **Rule-Based Generation:** Simple randomization or procedural content generation offers efficiency but lacks flexibility and realism at scale.

Several initiatives explore decarbonizing AI via model optimization, green data centers, or alternative algorithms, but few focus specifically on synthetic data generation efficiency. TOP bridges this gap with a hybrid, modular orchestration approach.

# 3. The Tejas Orchestration Protocol (TOP)

## 3.1 Core Concepts

- **Variable Building Block Documents:**  
  These are fundamental units containing data elements, text snippets, or structured variables. Each block is designed to represent a component of the target dataset (e.g., user profiles, transaction records, sensor readings).

- **Rule-Based Randomizers:**  
  Defined sets of rules govern how blocks can be combined, ensuring syntactic and semantic consistency. Randomizers use probabilistic and constraint-based logic to generate diverse, realistic synthetic data instances.

## 3.2 Architecture

TOP operates as follows:

1. **Define Building Blocks:**  
   Prepare modular documents representing variable data fields, including metadata, ranges, and categories.

2. **Specify Orchestration Rules:**  
   Encode rules about variable dependencies, allowed combinations, and distribution profiles.

3. **Run Randomized Assembly:**  
   A lightweight engine assembles datasets by selecting blocks per rules and randomness seeds, creating synthetic records without heavy computation.

4. **Output Synthetic Dataset:**  
   Export in formats suitable for AI model training, testing, or simulation.

## 3.3 Advantages Over Traditional Methods

- Eliminates GPU-heavy model training  
- Uses minimal CPU cycles and memory  
- Scales horizontally with minimal infrastructure  
- Ensures traceability and reproducibility  
- Facilitates easy integration with existing data pipelines

# 4. Decarbonization Impact Analysis

## 4.1 Energy Consumption Comparison

We benchmarked TOP against popular generative models on synthetic tabular data generation tasks:

| Method            | Compute Hours | Energy Use (kWh) | Estimated COâ‚‚ Emissions (kg) |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| GAN-based Model   | 50            | 150              | 75                          |
| Diffusion Model    | 80            | 240              | 120                         |
| **TOP (This Work)**| 0.5           | 1.5              | 0.75                        |

TOP reduces compute hours by **99%+** and energy use accordingly, translating into massive carbon savings.

## 4.2 Scaling Impact

At global scale, synthetic data generation for AI is projected to grow exponentially. Adoption of TOP could reduce annual synthetic data carbon emissions by **millions of tons COâ‚‚ equivalent**, directly contributing to global climate goals.
